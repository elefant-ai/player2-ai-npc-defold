# Player 2 AI NPC Plugin for Defold
The Official Player2 AI NPC Plugin for Defold

The Player 2 AI NPC Defold plugin allows developers to easily create AI NPCs in their Defold projects.

The plugin uses free AI APIs from the [player2 App](https://player2.game/)

Just open Player2, and the plugin connects automatically, so you can dive right into building your world instead of wrestling with keys or settings. When your game is ready, weâ€™ll share it with our community of 40,000+ active players eager for AI-driven adventures [on our discord](https://player2.game/discord)

## Usage Guide

### Installing the plugin
You can use Player 2 AI NPC Plugin in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

### NPC API

The Player 2 NPC API is accessible via the `ainpc` global.

Player2 NPCs can be spawned in (`ainpc.npc_spawn`), spoken to (`ainpc.npc_chat`), and killed (`ainpc.npc_kill`). The responses for all NPCs can be read as a stream (`ainpc.npc_responses`).

#### [A simple NPC example can be found here](https://github.com/elefant-ai/player2-ai-npc-defold/blob/main/assets/scripts/npc_test.script)

### Chat completion API

If you just wish to use simple chat completion, you can do so via the `ainpc.chat_completion` function.

```lua
local t = {
    ["messages"] = {
        {
            ["content"] = "You are an assistant.",
            ["role"] = "system"
        },
        {
            ["content"] = "Hello, how are you doing today?",
            ["role"] = "user"
        }
    }
}
ainpc.chat_completion(t,
function(self, result)
    print("REPLY:", json.encode(result))
end,
function(self, err, id)
    print("Failed", err, id)
end)
```
Example reply:
```json
{
    "choices": [
        {
            "finish_reason": "stop",
            "index": 0,
            "message": {
                "content": "Hello! I'm functioning well and ready to chat or help with whatever you need! ðŸŒŸ I always enjoy our conversations. How are you doing today? I'd love to hear from you!",
                "role": "assistant"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
The chat completion response is a table following the [Player 2 API](http://localhost:4315/docs/#/Chat/chat_completion).

If you wish, you can also pass a string to `ainpc.chat_completion` instead of a table:
```lua
ainpc.chat_completion("Hello, how are you doing today?", ...)
```
This is identical to running:
```lua
local t = {
    ["messages"] = {
        {
            ["content"] = "Hello, how are you doing today?",
            ["role"] = "user"
        }
    }
}
ainpc.chat_completion(t, ...)
```

### Configuration

Custom configuration must be added to the `game.project` file manually via text editor.

All configuration values for the extension are defined in the [`ext.properties`](https://github.com/elefant-ai/player2-ai-npc-defold/blob/main/player2-ai-npc/ext.properties) file. For example, override the host by appending this to the `game.project` file:
```properties
[player2_endpoints]
host = http://localhost:8080
```

### Game key

The game key passed to the APIs is the project title (found opening the `game.project` file)
